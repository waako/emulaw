 <p>As a Family Law Solicitor these are our aims as explained in the Family Law Act 1996 </p>
 <p>(a) that the institution of marriage is to be supported; </p>
 <p>(b) that the parties to a marriage which may have broken down are to be encouraged to take all practicable steps, whether by marriage counselling or otherwise, to save the marriage; </p>
 <p>(c) that a marriage which has irretrievably broken down and is being brought to an end should be brought to an end- </p>
 <p>(i) with minimum distress to the parties and to the children affected; </p>
 <p>(ii) with questions dealt with in a manner designed to promote as good a continuing relationship between the parties and any children affected as is possible in the circumstances; and </p>
 <p>(iii) without costs being unreasonably incurred in connection with the procedures to be followed in bringing the marriage to an end; and </p>
 <p>(d) that any risk to one of the parties to a marriage, and to any children, of violence from the other party should, so far as reasonably practicable, be removed or diminished. </p>
